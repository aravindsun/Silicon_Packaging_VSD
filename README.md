This repository contains detailed documentation about the semiconductor packaging workflow and various other aspects involved in packaging like thermal analysis, CAD modelling etc.

# Introduction to Semiconductor Packaging
Semiconductor Packaging is a process involved in the chip manufacturing workflow and serves two important purposes :-
      1) To protect the bare die from corrosion, moisture and physical damages that can happen in real world
      2) To enable the dies to connect with other dies or components

# Example of a chip package
The picture below illustrates the various components involved in a particular type of package called Ball Grid Array(BGA) package. The bare die is attached to a substrate(green) using a material called die attach. The connections from the die is taken out through the substarte via wires(wire bonding). Inorder to protect the die from external damages the entire die is covered with a molding component which is generally the ones which we see in real chips.
